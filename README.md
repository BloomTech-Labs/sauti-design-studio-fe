## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Kt9QUwpw/labs13-sauti-studio)

[Product Canvas](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/YAS77O8SMTK#/screens)

Sauti Studio + Design is a desktop product that aims to serve the East African communities by providing a simple tool that will allow individuals with no programming skills to build and customise a text based app to share information and knowledge. Sauti Studio + Design encourages anyone who experience the problems stemming from lack of information to take a stand and design their own solutions by laying out a USSD text-flow that can be accessed via simple phone.

Essentially, Sauti Studio + Design is a digital tool that will provide a  UI for building APIs designed to handle SMS/USSD requests.  User's should be able to build a simplified "flow" which saves as a series of nodes and connections.  This will also require thinking about the resulting API, which when sent a text query (with Session ID), returns the appropriate response. This REST API can then be integrated into Sautiâ€™s country specific USSD aggregator.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React/Gatsbyjs

Why did you choose this framework?

- Server-side rendering
- Quick loading times
- Industry standard
- SEO

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/labs13-sauti-studio/labs13-sauti-studio-BE) built using:

#### Express JS

- Express has a large community of users.
- Express is the most matured framework for Node.js with 5+ years of use.
- Express offers a quick and simple way to get a server up and running.

# APIs

### Africa's Talking
- Africa's talking was a no-brainer since our stakeholder's company is already using it in production.
- Africa's talking also works with the  ussd-menu-builder library which we are used to reduce workload.
- Africa's talking services East Africa, which is our target audience.

## Oauth

### Passport.js

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  GATSBY_API_URL=
    
# Installation Instructions

`yarn install`
or
`npm install`

## Other Scripts

    "build": "gatsby build",
    "develop": "gatsby develop",
    "format": "prettier --write src/**/*.{js,jsx}",
    "start": "npm run develop",
    "serve": "gatsby serve",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint --ignore-path .gitignore . --fix",
    "test": "echo \"Write tests! -> https://gatsby.dev/unit-testing\""
