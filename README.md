Sauti Studio + Design is a desktop product that aims to serve the East African communities by providing a simple tool that will allow individuals with no programming skills to build and customise a text based app to share information and knowledge. Sauti Studio + Design encourages anyone who experience the problems stemming from lack of information to take a stand and design their own solutions by laying out a USSD text-flow that can be accessed via simple phone.

Essentially, Sauti Studio + Design is a digital tool that will provide a  UI for building APIs designed to handle SMS/USSD requests.  User's should be able to build a simplified "flow" which saves as a series of nodes and connections.  This will also require thinking about the resulting API, which when sent a text query (with Session ID), returns the appropriate response. This REST API can then be integrated into Sautiâ€™s country specific USSD aggregator.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React/Redux

#### Front end deployed to `Amazon AWS`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/sauti-design-studio-be) built using:

#### Express/Node.js

- Express has a large community of users.
- Express is the most matured framework for Node.js with 5+ years of use.
- Express offers a quick and simple way to get a server up and running.

# APIs

### Africa's Talking
- Africa's talking was a no-brainer since our stakeholder's company is already using it in production.
- Africa's talking also works with the  ussd-menu-builder library which we are used to reduce workload.
- Africa's talking services East Africa, which is our target audience.

## Oauth

### Passport.js

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

## Diagramming

### [projectstorm react-diagrams](https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams)

Recently Developed by Dylan Voster, he is accessible via this [Gitter Page](https://gitter.im/projectstorm/react-diagrams). 

A flow & process orientated diagramming library inspired by Blender, Labview and Unreal engine.

- Modern Codebase written entirely in Typescript and React, the library makes use of powerful generics, advanced software engineering principles and is broken up into multiple modules.
- Hackable and extensible the entire library including its core can be extended, rewired and re-assembled into fundamentally different software to suit your own software needs.
- HTML nodes as a first class citizen the library was originally written to represent advanced dynamic nodes, that are difficult to represent as SVG's due to complex input requirements ux requirements.
- Designed for process the library is aimed for software engineers that want to rewire their programs at runtime, and that want to make their software more dynamic.
- Fast diagram editing the defaults provided give the heighest priority to editing diagrams as fast as possible.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_BE_API_URL='http://localhost:5000' OR Production Route 
    *  REACT_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN=https://dev-YOURACCOUNT.okta.com
    *  REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID= 

    
# Installation Instructions

`npm install` - to install dependencies

`npm start` - to start local application
